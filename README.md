# Bookmarks tab

A Chrome Extension that replaces the new tab page with a grid of bookmarks. 

[Install from the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ofijmedbafaffedkkhpgandnchdnbgoo) or download all files on this repo and ‚ÄúLoad unpacked‚Äù from `chrome://extensions`.

You can also launch it by clicking the extension‚Äôs icon or pressing `Alt+T`, which will work even if you don't want to set it as your newtab. You can change the keyboard shortcut from `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`.

## How to use

- **Add bookmark**: press the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon on the right of a group‚Äôs title.
  - Only a URL is needed. The title and icon are pulled automatically (tries web app manifest and apple-touch icons; falls back to favicons).
  - You can replace the icon with a custom image URL.
- **Edit or delete bookmark**: hover a bookmark and click the edit button (‚úé), or right click it. Delete from the edit modal.
- **Refresh metadata**: in the edit modal click the üîÅ button to fetch title/icon again. A preview shows the current icon.
- **Icon background**: in the edit modal click ‚ÄúBG‚Äù to toggle a white background behind the icon (useful for dark transparent PNGs). This is saved per bookmark and reflected on the main page.
- **Reorder bookmarks**: drag and drop (works across groups!).
- **Add a group**: Click on the ‚Äú**Add Group**‚Äù button on the bottom of the page.
- **Rename group**: hover the group title and click ‚ÄúRename‚Äù.
- **Reorder groups**: drag the group title.
- **Collapse/expand groups**: click the chevron (‚ñ∫/‚ñº) or the group title to toggle. State persists.

### Backup / Export / Import

- Click on the ‚Äú**Export Bookmarks**‚Äù button on the bottom of the page. It saves a JSON file containing your bookmarks, their group order, which groups are collapsed, and per-bookmark white background preferences.
- Click on ‚Äú**Import Bookmarks**‚Äù and select the JSON file to restore them.
